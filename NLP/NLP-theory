Most of NLP algorithms are classification models, and they include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, CART  which is a model based on decision trees,
Maximum Entropy again related to Decision Trees, Hidden Markov Models which are models based on Markov processes.

#Bag of Words model
A very well-known model in NLP is the Bag of Words model. It is a model used to preprocess the texts to classify 
before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the texts.
In this part, you will understand and learn how to:

Clean texts to prepare them for the Machine Learning models,
Create a Bag of Words model,
Apply Machine Learning models onto this Bag of Worlds model.

#There are classical and Deep Learning Models. The Bag-Of-Words model (Classification) is the most commonly used.
There are other models:
1.If/Else Rules - Chatbots
2. Audio frequency components analysis - Speech Recognition
3. CNN for text Recognition (Classification)
4. Seq2Seq (many applications)
(The Seq2Seq or Chatbots are other more advanced models.)
