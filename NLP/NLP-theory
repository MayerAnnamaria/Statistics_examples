Most of NLP algorithms are classification models, and they include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, CART  which is a model based on decision trees,
Maximum Entropy again related to Decision Trees, Hidden Markov Models which are models based on Markov processes.

#Bag of Words model
A very well-known model in NLP is the Bag of Words model. It is a model used to preprocess the texts to classify 
before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the texts.
In this part, you will understand and learn how to:

Clean texts to prepare them for the Machine Learning models,
Create a Bag of Words model,
Apply Machine Learning models onto this Bag of Worlds model.

#There are classical and Deep Learning Models. The Bag-Of-Words model (Classification) is the most commonly used.
There are other models:
1.If/Else Rules - Chatbots
2. Audio frequency components analysis - Speech Recognition
3. CNN for text Recognition (Classification)
4. Seq2Seq (many applications)
(The Seq2Seq or Chatbots are other more advanced models.)

If you are up for some practical activities, here is a little challenge:

1. Run the other classification models we made in Part 3 - Classification, other than the one we used in the last tutorial.

2. Evaluate the performance of each of these models. Try to beat the Accuracy obtained in the tutorial. 
But remember, Accuracy is not enough, so you should also look at other performance metrics like Precision (measuring exactness),
Recall (measuring completeness) and the F1 Score (compromise between Precision and Recall). Please find below these metrics formulas 
(TP = # True Positives, TN = # True Negatives, FP = # False Positives, FN = # False Negatives):

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

F1 Score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)

3. Try even other classification models that we haven't covered in Part 3 - Classification. Good ones for NLP include:

CART

Maximum Entropy
